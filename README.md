# Confucious Actions

What could be better than a ludicous and sarcastic comment when you fail a pull
request? With this action, that's what you get. It uses the 
[vanessa/boxes](https://www.github.com/vsoch/boxes) container to format
a lovely message from Confucious to your pull requests, but only if you fail.
