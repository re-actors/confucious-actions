# Confucious Actions

What could be better than a ludicous and sarcastic comment when you perform
some action on a Github pull request? This repository provides those actions,
with specific action types corresponding to the subfolders. We currently have:

 - [Pull Request Failure](pull_request_fail): Some wisdom when a pull request has status "failure"

These actions use the 
[vanessa/boxes](https://www.github.com/vsoch/boxes) container to format
a lovely message from Confucious to your pull requests, but only if you fail.
See the README.md in each subfolder for usage.
